# Nordic Test System with Distributed Resources

- type of simulation: EMT
- software: PowerFactory

Developed for the publication (**please cite**)

*Open-Source EMT Model of Grid-Forming Converter with Industrial Grade SelfSync and SelfLim Control* by Simon Eberlein, Peter Unruh and Tobias Erckrath, IEEE ISGT 2023, Grenoble.
