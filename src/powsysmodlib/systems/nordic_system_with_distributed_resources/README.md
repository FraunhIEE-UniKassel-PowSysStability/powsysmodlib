# Nordic Test System with Distributed Resources

- type of simulation: EMT
- software: PowerFactory

Developed for the publication
*Open-Source EMT Model of Grid-Forming Converter with Industrial Grade SelfSync and SelfLim Control*
(IEEE ISGT 2023).
See also *github.com/FraunhIEE-UniKassel-PowSysStability/paper_isgt_2023_selfsync*.

The synchronous machines are replaced by distributed energy resources. Please have a look at the publication mentioned above for further information.
